Understanding Edge AI systems from low-level runtimes to robotics deployment

Edge AI — From the Metal Up is a hands-on learning repository focused on understanding how AI systems actually run on edge devices, not just how models are trained.

Instead of treating inference, robotics middleware, and messaging as black boxes, this repository explores how runtimes, executors, memory, and communication layers work together to build reliable, deployable edge AI systems.

The goal is to build mental models and practical intuition for edge deployment by studying and experimenting with real production-grade systems.

This repository focuses on:

1. How inference runtimes are designed
2. Why executors and lifecycles matter
3. How memory, threading, and messaging affect reliability
4. What actually breaks in real edge deployments
